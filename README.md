# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
The goal of this project is to analyze telecom customer data to predict customer churn, enabling the company to identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them.

### Project Objectives:
1. **Data Collection and Integration**: Gather and integrate data from various sources such as customer service records, call logs, billing information, and customer demographics.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Ensure data quality through cleaning and transformation processes.
3. **Data Storage and Management**: Utilize MySQL for efficient storage and management of large datasets.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and uncover insights.
5. **Churn Prediction Model**: Develop a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn.
6. **Reporting and Visualization**: Create dashboards and reports for stakeholders to monitor churn rates and model performance.

### Data Requirements:
1. **Customer Demographics**: Information such as age, gender, location, etc.
2. **Service Usage Data**: Details of call durations, data usage, number of SMS sent, etc.
3. **Billing Information**: Monthly charges, payment history, overdue payments, etc.
4. **Customer Support Interactions**: Records of customer service interactions, complaints, and resolutions.
5. **Contract Information**: Contract duration, type of plan, renewal date, etc.

### Database Schema:
The MySQL database schema might include the following tables:
1. **Customers**: `customer_id`, `name`, `age`, `gender`, `location`
2. **Services**: `service_id`, `service_type`, `service_description`
3. **Usage**: `usage_id`, `customer_id`, `service_id`, `date`, `call_duration`, `data_used`, `sms_sent`
4. **Billing**: `billing_id`, `customer_id`, `billing_date`, `amount_due`, `amount_paid`, `payment_status`
5. **Customer_Support**: `interaction_id`, `customer_id`, `interaction_date`, `issue_type`, `resolution_status`
6. **Contracts**: `contract_id`, `customer_id`, `plan_type`, `contract_start_date`, `contract_end_date`

### Step-by-Step Implementation:

#### Step 1: Data Collection and Integration
- Collect data from various sources and import it into the MySQL database.
- Use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to ensure data consistency and integrity.

#### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Identify and handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
- Normalize and standardize data where necessary.

#### Step 3: Data Storage and Management
- Design and create the database schema in MySQL.
- Import the cleaned data into the respective tables.

#### Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Use SQL queries to perform EDA, such as calculating churn rates, average service usage, and identifying high-risk customer segments.

#### Step 5: Churn Prediction Model
- Export the data from MySQL to a machine learning environment (e.g., Python).
- Preprocess the data and engineer features relevant to churn prediction.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a predictive model using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

#### Step 6: Reporting and Visualization
- Develop dashboards using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or MySQL Workbench for data visualization.
- Create reports that highlight key findings and actionable insights for the management team.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Database Management**: MySQL
- **Data Analysis and Modeling**: Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn)
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, MySQL Workbench
- **ETL Tools**: Apache Nifi, Talend

### Expected Outcomes:
- A well-structured MySQL database containing all relevant data for churn analysis.
- Insights into factors contributing to customer churn.
- A predictive model with the ability to identify at-risk customers.
- Interactive dashboards and reports for ongoing monitoring and decision-making.

### Conclusion:
By implementing this project, a telecom company can leverage its data to gain insights into customer behavior, improve customer retention strategies, and ultimately reduce churn rates. Using MySQL as the backbone for data management ensures scalability and efficiency in handling large datasets typical in the telecom industry.
